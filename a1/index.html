        <h2>What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience?</h2>
        <p>The monkey. This gif stood out from the rest due to the visual difference between the background and foreground. Knowing a bit about what monkeys represent as well, it was quite clear that pressing the monkey would make things go crazy and be the way forwards. I felt no need to try and deal with the annoying popup text.</p>
        <br>
        
        <h2>Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your discrete actions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li> I clicked the monkey</li>
            <li> I clicked Confirm </li>
            <li>I clicked Okay </li>
            <li>I drag Bones Over the screen </li>
            <li>I drag Recycle Bin over the screen </li>
            <li> I drag Bones into Recycle Bin </li>
            <li> I miss click the Bones and start clicking the background </li>
            <li> I click the Light Switch </li>
            <li> I click Ghost </li>
            <li> I click the Light Switch </li>
            <li> I click Start </li>
            <li> I drag Key into Neighbourhood </li>
            <li> I click a link </li> 
            <li> I click a link </li>
            <li> I click Cat </li>
        </ol>
        <br>

        <h2>What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?</h2>
        <p>The background image of the page. There were two types of interactions you could have with it. One was dragging the Recycle Bin that was on fire, leaving a trail of flames. The other was clicking the background, leaving space holes. Both of these interested me as I wonder how they were coded and it was just therapeutic to drag and click at a rapid speed.</p>
        <br>

        <h2>What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the experience?</h2>
        <p> Clicking. The whole experience felt like a Point & Click game, I ended up clicking anything that seemed interesting, some icons took you somewhere else and that required more clicking to progress. Sometimes icons had no significance but I still click just to make sure they were not hiding any secrets.</p>
        <br>

        <h2>What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?</h2>
        <p>To be an engaging visual experience that exposes the secrets of the web.</p>
        <br>

        <h2>What is your impression of how the interactive experience communicates its primary goal?</h2>
        <p> It communicates its goal quite nicely. When the user enters the site for the first time, there is a good chance they have no idea what they have got themselves into. This confusion creates fear as the screen is often overloaded with content, replicating malware. Going deeper in by pressing sketchy icons and links reveals texts that expose what the web is doing behind closed doors. When pressing the monkey and even leaving the site you are presented with flashy lights and still images that were not there before. These techniques are used to create fear through confusion as everything has happened so suddenly.</p>
        <br>

        <h2>What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with over time?</h2>
        <p>This experience isn't something you will come back to. The only time people would revisit it, is if they wanted to try and find all the secrets and if the site was inspirational. The site is an artwork that will most likely not have the same emotional impact upon revisiting. The time spent on the site depends on the user, if they are truly invested they will end up down a rabbit hole and might spend up to an hour. Others may be turned away out of fear or not understanding the way around the site, Most likely only spending 10 mins.</p>
        <br>

        <h2>What is your impression of how the interactive experience communicates how it should be interacted with over time?</h2>
        <p>It's pretty clear that this site will take up a lot of your time, from all the buttons presented and secrets to be discovered. The site replicates early internet web pages which are known to be creative in the interface, often at times making it hard to navigate. When you come back again out of curiosity, all the things you missed become visible such as in the top left where you will find links to other sites the creator has made.</p>

        <div class="box-background"><h3>Week 3</h3></div>

        <h2>What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience reference?</h2>
        <p>The style and experience of this website reference the early internet. The most noticeable being Yahoo! GeoCities, a hosting site where anyone could publish a website for free. With the excitement around the internet and what customizations it had on offer, many threw together whatever they liked onto their home pages, creating a pleasing mess.</p>
        <br>

        <h2>What does this reference or references suggest to you about how you should act when engaging with it?</h2>
        <p>When viewing this site, you should act with an open mind, one that is curious and patient. UI during the early internet wasn’t as planned as is it now, these pages are filled with bold text, bright clashing colours and tons of icons to press. This can be very jarring compared to modern UI design and therefore many will be turned off by the website. Since GeoCities had a bright and fun atmosphere they should be treated like a Point & Click game. There isn't one clear user journey so you need to engage with interest.</p>
        <br>

        <h2>What does this reference or references suggest to you about how you should feel when engaging with it?</h2>
        <p> For those who witnessed the creation of the internet, they should be feeling a sense of nostalgia. All the bright colours, the weary text and imagery, fun sounds, and interesting visuals all align with the early internet style. This group would most likely know what the website statement is all about and would have fun with the experience. Those who have grown up with the internet should be feeling a sense of caution when interacting. This group has more knowledge of how dangerous the internet can be and would feel like they have just activated malware. The style is also far removed from modern UI but still has some noticeable features like the start button, making the user feel safe as there is a sense of familiarity.</p>
        <br>

        <h2>What is the most frustrating element of the interaction to you and what makes it frustrating?</h2>
        <p>A lack of a back/undo button. Since the experience is recapturing the early Internet, there is a lot of interaction that opens a new website. Within these websites, there isn't a link back to the previous page, the only way to go back is by pressing the original website tab in your internet explorer. This doesn't sit right with me, if the home page offer to take you to a new page that is linked to the experience, then that new page should link back to the experience. It interrupts the flow. Interacting with the background also made me wish I could undo my mess and create a clean canvas. This lack of going back doesn’t align with modern UX requirements and was somewhat irritating at times.</p>
        <br>

        <h2>What is the most satisfying element of the interaction to you and what makes it satisfying?</h2>
        <p>How smoothy interactions responded. Outdated technology can often have response issues and since this site is referencing old technology, it was quite a surprise to see how smoothly the skeleton responded to being dragged, along with its physics. This also applies to how fast the experience loaded. Quite a juxtaposition to the early internet. This made the experience flow very nicely and suited to a modern audience who have less attention and time to waste.</p>
