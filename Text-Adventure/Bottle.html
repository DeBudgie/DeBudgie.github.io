                <h4>Summary</h4>
                <br>
                <p>Sharing memories from our past can be a hard thing to achieve. Often, we warp the narrative to make the past idealised, but that story was told from another perspective. We are no longer that person, so let's reflect rather than escape. 30th of March 2016, Chiba, Japan. A younger version of me went on exchange, Where we cracked clams for their pearls. An amusing time passer that lightens the mood in a room of strangers. My body would be paralysed if I did such an event back home. Yet now the moment seen from the lens of another tells a new story. One where my mind isn't comfortable, speaking words I would never say. My body relaxed, my mind as well, but not switch on to how I want to be perceived. There is a disconnect between mind and body, only identifiable when reflection is in play. Noticing such ideas can help our younger self look to the future with delight.</p>
                <br>
                <p>This is the feeling I want to achieve in my interaction, with the help of Imagism. The work set out to capture a space, showcasing the pearls I found that day. Yet under their shiny surface highlights the abstract feeling in my mind at that time. Using <a href="https://skfb.ly/oorCO">Crystal_3D's Jar model</a> I was able to recreate how I store these pearls and give them a frame to incorporate textures of haziness from <a href="https://pixabay.com/illustrations/abstract-patten-background-purple-6364773/">Chenspec,</a><a href="https://pixabay.com/photos/winter-cold-surface-ice-texture-2054297/">Goumbik,</a><a href="https://pixabay.com/illustrations/background-texture-abstract-art-6556385/">Ksushlapush</a> and <a href="https://pixabay.com/illustrations/background-texture-old-vintage-2482338/">8926.</a> <a href="https://github.com/keijiro/KinoGlitch">Keijiro's glitch</a> allowed for a digital camera effect, reflecting how I can see this memory from my host father's camera. Incorporating audio from <a href="https://pixabay.com/music/modern-classical-soulful-ambient-atmosphere-156430/">UNIVERSFIELD</a> helps to create a peaceful reflection, as this wasn’t a bad experience, but looking back on it, you see the struggle within me.</p>

                <br>
                <p>This project was completed in the middle of my journey. Allowing for a heavy focus on clarity within what the digital is capable of. My written understanding of the topic was a strong area, so I furthered my understanding of grand ideas for this project. Translating these ideas into the digital often resulted in a great environment and an okay interaction. This time I took the interaction approach. Having items change upon interacting with them is a common digital interaction and I tried to give this action some depth. However, this project idea falls flat without any knowledge of what is being communicated. The idea is still solid, deep diving into a topic and connecting it to yourself has been a great takeaway, that will help to further my practices. The problem here is the work itself. When trying to improve from my first project I just naturally fell back into doing what wasn’t required of me. I had all that I needed to not make the same mistakes but did so anyway. This is what I've learned from this work. To be more critical of what I'm creating and if it really is conveying the message I want to communicate.</p>
