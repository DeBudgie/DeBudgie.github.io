                <h2>Minimalism - Artwork that eludes the process of creation and meaning, to call forward interest in work material and the space it occupies</h2>
                <br>
                <h3>Characterize by nature, lack of item interpretations, earthly materials, reflecting on the space, movement, contentment</h3>
                <br>
                <br>
                <h4>Summary</h4>
                <br>
                <p>Digital environments are often the backdrop for an interaction, when they are called forward it's most likely due to them replicating nature's beauty. This is a space that has its own rules, so why not make something within it that highlights how it's a completely different space from our own. It can be warped and coded to create any kind of experience.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Showcasing this in a minimalist fashion results in a reflection of your movement within the space. If you move too fast, you will miss the shadows. The light hits the cubes in such a way as to bring awareness to how this environment is unlike our own. If you think too deeply about the shape material, you will miss how they represent what the cube is made up of. There is nothing to show but that these items were created digitally. All together everything presented goes back to a digital basic, no special assets just the world of the digital. Things just existing are special in themselves, a moment to appreciate and hold on to as the moment is ever-changing.</p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <h4>Reflection</h4>
                <br>
                <p>Being my first project in this journey, I was focused on ensuring I got the ideas of minimal design right, along with ensuring I understood what the digital had to offer. Being my first try at a minimal environment I was trying to make sure that it wasn't too big or meaningless. The scale was ideal and helped to guide future projects to be around the same size. The detail was ideal too, there were just enough things to make the world not seem empty in assets and space. However, the idea fell flat, not only in writing but in execution. What I was trying to showcase could not stand on its own and needed the writing to support it. This is something I'll be considering in these projects and for future ones down the line. This was only the beginning so next I wanted to try and incorporate assets found online to make more defined spaces. This work helped me to understand what areas I needed to improve on within this style of design.
