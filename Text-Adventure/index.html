            <h4>About the website</h4> 
            <p>Catch up showcases my journey throughout the studio of Minimalist interaction and Environment. The journey itself hasn’t been a defined path into a particular area. I've only just been introduced to the world of 3D, therefore I haven't created work that would help to improve a particular area. I've just been exploring themes that interest me while thinking up ways to compose It. This has led to some work being strong on their own with words helping to further connect to the idea, while others need the writing to make sense. Half the time the writing doesn't make any sense anyway. I notice this happens quite a bit when I'm speaking, when I can't find the right words, I just want the conversation to stop. This is what I wanted to show on this website. Words can often be straightforward and connect to a person or they can go around in circles and fall flat. This relates to my project journey, To me each work theme and execution makes sense in the beginning, but when I explain the connection between idea and build, things start to not make sense. This experimental approach makes sense within my journey, within the design of Interaction and Environment. It isn't an area I wish to pursue, that goes to video editing, yet it's been something new to pop up on my radar that has interested me.</p>

            <h4>The process and learning journey</h4>
            <p>This journey began with me trying to ensure I understood the ideas behind minimal design and the ways we interact with the digital. This resulted in a simple environment that manipulated the rules of digital engines, to make something new that could not be done in reality. It was hard to understand what this space was trying to tell but the idea where heading in the right direction. So I went on to use other people's assets to help support what I wanted to say. When creating an environment, using other people's work helps me to understand movement and space. For interaction, it helps to frame items in a flat space. Around this time I was starting to understand how to make environments that were not too grand and empty or too small and tight. This being my first interaction I stuck to keeping this simple to get the idea across. This time I also merge ideas that interest me and personal experiences. Understating this has become a key takeaway from this process. It helps to further develop my style. That’s what I took into the last three works, making sure I use assets that I created, to develop my style but also offer a subliminal look into who I am and the feeling I'm trying to convey. Most of my environment has been developed well with what I have learned, however, my interaction still seems a bit lacking. Creating more interaction at the end has helped me to identify what I need to work on. In order to not make an abstract interaction, there needs to be a strong connection to the themes, I need to keep questioning if this really works and get other input. I also should try and push a simple interaction or make it stronger. I don’t need to think outside the box all the time to make something grand.</p>

            <h4>Final through</h4>
            <p>This class has helped me to understand the direction I wish to take my personal style. I really enjoy works that are simple in composition but have a strong meaning behind them. Since most of my work falls under abstract, I need to get better at making my idea in writing clear, and then figure out how to create a connection with the visuals. The ideas I have learned from lectures have already been impacting my approach to other projects. Thinking about how to bring in limits, connecting works and implementing grand ideas, has helped to create work that is rooted in humanity. This is definitely something I wish all my future projects to have. This has been a fun learning experience in a creative field that has my interest, but not enough to change my path. Yet everything I've learned will definitely be present in other projects I create in the future.
