                <h4>Summary</h4>
                <br>
                <p>Getting a haircut can be stressful, a bad experience can often be imprinted In our memory. There are others waiting right behind you, their book in and ready to go next. You can't hold up the hairdresser for too long but you also have to put yourself first. Everyone interprets lengths and styles differently. You have no clue what the final cut will look like and you can't go back ones the scissor cuts. Stressful right? Why not just laugh off the experience?</p>
                <br>
                <p>That is just what this microgame sets out to perform. Combined with fast-paced movement and a lack of direction, chaos seeps in. A digital moving shape sorter in a clean empty hairdresser, with each cut-out wall triggering a different custom hair model. At the end of the rush, you get to see the brand-new hairstyle you created. The possibilities are endless for a good or bad haircut! <a href="https://pixabay.com/music/upbeat-barber-amp-the-haircut-146888/">Hirken8 song</a> helps to keep everything light-hearted, as this is a bad experience turned fun.</p>

                <h4>Reflection</h4>
                <br>
                <p>Heading into the final stages of this journey, I knew I needed to present ideas clearly and have them supported by my own assets. I made the ideas more friendly and focused on situations that can be personally difficult, but turn it into a fun experience. Using my own 3D models also allows for the work to be more personal, creating that connection between ideas and executions. Using an asset I had already created was the key to being able to spend more time with the idea and make it understandable. I saw this work as more of an environment but looking back I now see it as an interaction as well. Both of these things coming together helped to make this one of my stronger works. Using the practice of interaction that happens without your input would merge well in a video context. The environment itself might not be that grand, but creating its basic shape helped me to further develop the placement of items in a digital setting. The next step from here would be to fill the world with details that would bring it to life.</p>
