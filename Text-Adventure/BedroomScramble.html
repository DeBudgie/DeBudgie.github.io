                <h4>Summary</h4>
                <br>
                <p>Rearranging a space we care about can create a refreshing environment. For young people a bedroom is often the only space they get for themselves, making the room a safe and personal space. Getting that natural spark to rearrange is a welcoming sensation, however, to live up to that spark, rearranging can be a 2-day task. Thinking of a new layout, dusting, removing posters and items, and thinking of new ways to display your items can take a lot out of you. This experience should not be a negative drain on your health but rather therapeutic.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>I wish to capture those feelings within this Microgame. Creating a new room layout can run into the night, not only are you running out of time to do a thing you love but you also lose natural light. It might be time to stop and go to bed. With a range of bedroom items available in different rotations, you can drag and drop these items to create your own bedroom layout. Just make sure to do so before nightfall or you might end up making some weird layout choices. A calming lo-fi track by <a href="//pixabay.com/music/beats-lofi-in-the-bedroom-115136/">BrentinDavis</a> helps to keep this interaction peaceful and not get angry at the calming night stealing time for something you love doing.</p>

                <h4>Reflection</h4>
                <br>
                <p>This project was one of my final works. What needed improving was ensuring that the ideas behind the work were clear and having them supported with original assets. To tone down the idea, I started to focus on simply who I am and what makes me happy. To help develop my style I went about creating my own assets. I knew that if I was going to make an interaction, the action needed to connect to the ideas and I believe I achieved just that. Moving things in the digital isn't uncommon but it offers quicker movement of items that are not easily movable in reality. Making a peaceful room planner can help highlight how this type of interaction is a fun experience for me, but can also be tricky with limited free time. I think the message still gets a bit cloudy in the final work, but it helps to show that I'm on the right path for implementing interaction. This project also helped me to see that making simple interactions can still be successful and I donâ€™t need to think outside the box all the time. Keeping things rooted in humanity is also a great way for others to connect to art.</p>
