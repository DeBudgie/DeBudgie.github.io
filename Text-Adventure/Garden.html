                <h4>Summary</h4>
                <br>
                <p>Sharing memories from our past can be a hard thing to achieve. Often, we warp the narrative to make the past idealised, but that story was told from another perspective. We are no longer that person, so let's reflect rather than escape. 26th of March 2016, Chiba, Japan. A younger version of me went on exchange, taking photos of flowers in public. Informing myself at the time that my mind was at peace. Doing such an act at home frightened me. Yet now the photos of flowers tell me a new story. One where I am embarrassed. Looking down with a camera was much easier on my body than if I were to look up and snap a photo. There is a disconnect between mind and body, only identifiable when reflection is in play. Noticing such ideas can help our younger self look to the future with delight.</p>
                <br>
                <p>This is what my digital environment set out to communicate, using the ideas of Haiku. I wished to reimage the tranquil garden I saw and connect it to an identical garden of discomfort, that would force a user to look down. Using <a href="https://skfb.ly/o6psq">Liang's Japanese garden model</a> I rearranged the setting to become an isolated floating island. Reflecting on the photo motif, <a href="https://skfb.ly/6WMyVCreating">Lion.gelders's Camera model</a> helped to create a digital gateway into a garden of anxiety. The garden I now see upon reflection was created using <a href="https://skfb.ly/owqyy">Exleute's Skyscrapers.</a> Scattered with <a href="https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/vegetation/simple-low-poly-decorative-plant-assets-252714#releases">Ultrasonic's flowers</a> and tracks from <a href="https://pixabay.com/music/meditationspiritual-a-quiet-time-8128/">NaturesEye's</a> the world sits in the digital plane in order to create reflection.</p>

                <h4>Reflection</h4>
                <br>
                <p>This project was completed in the middle of my journey. Allowing for a heavy focus on clarity within a digital environment. My strengths lied in the written understanding of the topic and aspects that are only capable in the digital. I made sure to incorporate these elements with the written being reflected in the assets I used, replicating what Haiku highlights. The digital is shown through the camera asset, transporting you to an identical space and mirroring how this memory is only seen clearly thanks to the digital. The one thing I needed to double down from the first project was the concept. So I went on to merge ideas that interest me and personal experiences. Understating this has become a key takeaway from this process and at the time, was already influencing other projects I was working on. Coming back to this work, I see now that to further push the personal aspect that I want to incorporate, I need to create everything that I use. Not only will this help to develop my style but also offer a subliminal look into who I am and my feeling towards what the work is conveying.</p>
