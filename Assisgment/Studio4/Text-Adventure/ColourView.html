                <h4>Summary</h4>
                <br>
                <p>Commercially, the world is losing its colour and individuation. You can often get lost in a car park with all the white, grey and black cars. What happened to the colour? You often see remnants of old building paint fading away, even if it's disappearing it already has more colour than the dull corporate building next to it. Old bollard stands out from the clean-cut ones and you are left to wonder what a nice commodity. Why not make it the norm?</p>
                <br>
                <p>What this work plans to show is just this process of loss. A personal model medieval column is in contrast to a modern one. Slowly, its colour fades away, as you turn the work you are unable to see what it once was. Being content with what you see. There is nothing else to compare it to and you are left with either a more individual piece of craft or an identical cookie cutter piece. The music from <a href="https://pixabay.com/music/electronic-deep-sleep-13363/">KELLEPICS</a> and <a href="https://pixabay.com/music/main-title-middle-ages-147373/">Lexin_Music</a> helps to further this point. It hurts that the individual one would cost more and isn't obtainable for everyone. But is really better for everyone to be left with a cold piece of work.</p>

                <h4>Reflection</h4>
                <br>
                <p>This project was one of my final works. The main areas for improvement were presenting ideas clearly and creating my own assets. My thinking to make ideas clearer came from toning down the ideas, where I now focus on simply who I am and what personal views I have. To help develop my style I needed to make my own assets. However I felt a bit scared to create my own 3D assets due to a tight time frame, so I made sure to not make anything too grand. This however resulted in another abstract work. Throughout making this work, I kept asking myself if this was too abstract and too simple for an interaction, but I kept ignoring those questions. While interaction should focus on a key element of the digital, I never really push what the interaction can do. I instead tried to showcase an idea with very little connection to the interaction. Learning from this trial, I can see now that I still have a while until I can successfully implement interactions with grand ideas. Or it's a sign that I stay away from such. As my interest is heading in a video design direction. Learning about how we interact with the digital is still a key bit of knowledge if you want to work in a digital space.</p>
